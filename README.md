# Food_Restaurant
Sangam Hotel is a modern and responsive restaurant website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to design a creative, user-friendly, and attractive website for a food restaurant that gives visitors a real experience of browsing menus, placing orders, checking location, and reading or posting reviews.
The website starts with a Home section that welcomes customers with animations, visuals, and a short introduction about the hotel. In the Menu section, all food items are displayed in a clean grid format, each showing the food name, price in rupees, and an “Add to Cart” button. This helps customers easily browse and select their favorite dishes.

The Order Now section allows customers to view the items they added to their cart, see the total price, and proceed with the order using the order button. The Location section integrates Google Maps, making it easy for visitors to find Sangam Hotel. The Review section contains sample customer reviews and a form where new customers can submit their own feedback by entering their name, email, and message.

The website also includes a footer with social media links like Facebook and Instagram, along with copyright details. The design is fully responsive, meaning it works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
